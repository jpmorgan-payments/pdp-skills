# J.P. Morgan Payments Developer Portal — Merchant Integrations Agent Skills

A set of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) that give GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, and other Agent harnesses procedural knowledge of J.P. Morgan's Payments Developer Portal (PDP) APIs. They provide a conversational experience that walks you from getting started with J.P. Morgan Payments APIs to integrating with new ones and expanding your integration — without you having to re-read the docs.

## What's Inside

This repository ships **three Agent Skills** that chain together. Each also works on its own.

| Skill | Path | Purpose |
| ----- | ---- | ------- |
| `jpm-integrations-get-started` | [`skills/jpm-integrations-get-started/`](skills/jpm-integrations-get-started/SKILL.md) | Get started with J.P. Morgan Payments — disclaimer acknowledgment, goal triage, credential check, and `.env` setup |
| `jpm-oauth` | [`skills/jpm-oauth/`](skills/jpm-oauth/SKILL.md) | Generates a working OAuth (JWT signing + IDAnywhere token exchange) module in your project, with token caching baked in |
| `jpm-merchant-integrations` | [`skills/jpm-merchant-integrations/`](skills/jpm-merchant-integrations/SKILL.md) | Walks you through one API integration at a time — Checkout or Online Payments — and helps you expand by adding new APIs over time |

Each skill folder is composed of three layers:

| Layer | Path | Purpose |
| ----- | ---- | ------- |
| **SKILL.md** | `SKILL.md` | Entry point — the playbook the agent follows |
| **References** | `references/` | Per-API deep dives with flow diagrams, endpoint tables, field constraints, and sample requests |
| **Examples / Templates / Scripts** | `examples/`, `templates/`, `scripts/` | Reference samples and helpers the skill points to during execution |

### API Coverage

| API | Reference File | What It Covers |
| --- | -------------- | -------------- |
| **Checkout** | `skills/jpm-merchant-integrations/references/checkout.md` | Drop-in UI, Hosted Payments Page, checkout sessions, capture methods, field constraints |
| **Online Payments** | `skills/jpm-merchant-integrations/references/online-payments.md` | Full payment lifecycle (auth, capture, void, refund), card / wallet / APM methods, 3-D Secure |

More APIs (Tokenization, Reporting, and others) are planned for future releases.

## Installation

The skills are written in the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) format and load in any compatible Agent harness. Below are the install paths for the two primary harnesses — **Claude Code** and **GitHub Copilot**.

### Claude Code

The fastest path is the Claude Code plugin manager — this repository ships as a plugin with a marketplace manifest at the root.

#### Plugin install (recommended)

Inside Claude Code, run:

```text
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/jpmorgan-payments/pdp-skills
/plugin install jpm-payments-skills@jpm-payments-skills
```

After install, run `/plugin` to confirm it's listed and `/skills` to see the three `jpm-*` skills.

To update later:

```text
/plugin update jpm-payments-skills
```

#### Manual install (alternative)

If you'd rather copy the skills directly into your project, Claude Code auto-discovers any skills under `.claude/skills/`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jpmorgan-payments/pdp-skills /tmp/jpm-skills
mkdir -p .claude/skills
cp -r /tmp/jpm-skills/skills/jpm-* .claude/skills/
```

For a user-level install (every Claude Code project sees the skills), copy into `~/.claude/skills/` instead.

### GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot automatically discovers skills placed in `.github/skills/` at the root of your repository. No extra configuration is needed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jpmorgan-payments/pdp-skills /tmp/jpm-skills
mkdir -p .github/skills
cp -r /tmp/jpm-skills/skills/jpm-* .github/skills/
```

Open your project in VS Code or a JetBrains IDE with GitHub Copilot Chat enabled, then start asking questions. Copilot loads the relevant skill automatically when your prompt matches the skill's `description` field.

> **Tip:** You can invoke a skill explicitly via its slash command (for example, `/jpm-integrations-get-started`, `/jpm-oauth`, or `/jpm-merchant-integrations`) — works the same in both Claude Code and GitHub Copilot. Otherwise, any prompt that matches the skill's `description` field triggers it automatically.

---

## Usage

### Full walkthrough (recommended)

Start with the first skill — it hands off automatically through the full sequence:

```text
/jpm-integrations-get-started
```

`jpm-integrations-get-started` → `jpm-oauth` → `jpm-merchant-integrations`

### Individual skills

| Goal | Slash command |
| ---- | ------------- |
| Onboarding & `.env` setup | `/jpm-integrations-get-started` |
| Generate OAuth module | `/jpm-oauth` |
| Integrate Checkout or Online Payments | `/jpm-merchant-integrations` |

> Each skill checks its own prerequisites and will tell you what to run first if anything is missing.
